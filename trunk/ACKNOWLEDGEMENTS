This project reimplements and extends a C implementation of Dennis Klatt's
Fortran implementation of his cascade-parallel formant synthesizer, as published
in JASA.

From the C implementation, as written by Jon Iles (j.p.iles@cs.bham.ac.uk):
	The code was posted to comp.speech in 1993, and has been updated by me to fix
	a number of bugs that had been introduced. Subsequently major rewrites have
	been done by Nick Ing-Simmons to improve efficiency and change the code into
	a more acceptable ANSI C style, and by me to remove all global variable
	references, fix bugs and ensure portability.

	(c) 1993 Jon Iles and Nick Ing-Simmons

This project borrows algorithmic enhancements and inspiration from a SimulinkÂ®
implementation of the Klatt Synthesizer model, as described by Sean McLennan in
2000 for S522 - Digital Signal Processing under Dr. Diane Kewley-Port at Indiana
University.
