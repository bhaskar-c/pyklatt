	"""
	Lops off half of the current sound, if it's a vowel followed by a nasal, and
	inserts one sixth and one third of its duration as two nasalized variants of
	the vowel's parameters.
	
	The input list of parameters is not altered by this function.
	
	Nasalization concept inspired by a function described in "Klatt Synthesizer
	in SimulinkÂ®", a graduate research paper written by Sean McLennan in 2000 for
	S522 - Digital Signal Processing under Dr. Diane Kewley-Port at Indiana
	University. This information, lacking in-text licensing terms, is presumed to

	    the IPA character being processed. The first element is assumed to be the
