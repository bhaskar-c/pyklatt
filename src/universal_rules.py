	Lops off 0.1s from the end of the current sound, if it's a vowel followed by
	a nasal, and inserts 0.1s of a nasalized variant of the vowel's parameters.
	
	Nasalization concept inspired by a function described in "Klatt Synthesizer
	in SimulinkÂ®", a graduate research paper written by Sean McLennan in 2000 for
	S522 - Digital Signal Processing under Dr. Diane Kewley-Port at Indiana
	University. This information, lacking in-text licensing terms, is presumed to
