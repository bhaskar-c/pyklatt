	"""
	Lops off 0.05s from the end of the current sound, if it's a vowel followed by
	a nasal, and inserts 0.05s of two nasalized variants of the vowel's
	parameters.
	
	The input list of parameters is not altered by this function.
	
	Nasalization concept inspired by a function described in "Klatt Synthesizer
	in SimulinkÂ®", a graduate research paper written by Sean McLennan in 2000 for
	S522 - Digital Signal Processing under Dr. Diane Kewley-Port at Indiana
	University. This information, lacking in-text licensing terms, is presumed to
	have been published as public-domain work or otherwise under terms agreeable

	@type ipa_character: unicode
	@param ipa_character: The character, representative of a phoneme, being

	@type following_phonemes: sequence
	@param following_phonemes: A collection of all phonemes, in order, that
	    follow the current IPA character in the current word.
	@type parameters_list: list
	@param parameters_list: A collection of all sounds currently associated with
	    the IPA character being processed. The first element is assumed to be the
	    base sound, and any additional sounds will be inserted immediately after
	    it, occupying indecies 1 and 2 and offsetting any other elements in the
