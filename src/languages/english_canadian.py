CPSC 599 module: src.languages.english_canadian

Purpose
=======
 Contains a collection of rules to apply to phonemes.
 
Language
========
 This file applies to Canadian English.
 
Usage
=====
 All functions declared in this module for external iteration must have the
 following input signature:
  - B{C{ipa_character}} (unicode) - The character, representative of a phoneme,
    being processed.
  - B{C{preceding_phonemes}} (sequence) - A collection of all phonemes, in order,
    that precede the current IPA character in the current word.
  - B{C{following_phonemes}} (sequence) - A collection of all phonemes, in order,
    that follow the current IPA character in the current word.
  - B{C{word_position}} (int) - The current word's position in its sentence,
    indexed from 1.
  - B{C{remaining_words}} (int) - The number of words remaining before the end of
    the sentence is reached, not including the current word.
  - B{C{previous_words}} (sequence) - A collection of all words that have been
    previously synthesized.
  - B{C{following_words}} (sequence) - A collection of all words that have yet to
    be synthesized.
  - B{C{sentence_position}} (int) - The current sentence's position in its
    paragraph, indexed from 1.
  - B{C{remaining_sentences}} (int) - The number of sentences remaining before
    the end of the paragraph is reached, not including the current sentence.
  - B{C{is_quoted}} (bool) - True if the current word is part of a quoted body.
  - B{C{is_emphasized}} (bool) - True if the current word is part of an
    emphasized body.
  - B{C{is_content}} (bool) - True if the current word was marked as a content
    word.
  - B{C{is_question}} (bool) - True if the current sentence ends with a question
    mark.
  - B{C{is_exclamation}} (bool) - True if the current sentence ends with an
    exclamation mark.
  - B{C{previous_phoneme_parameters}} (list) - A collection of all parameters that
    appear as part of this phoneme, prior to the parameter-set currently being
    manipulated.
  - B{C{remaining_phoneme_parameter_count}} (int) - The number of parameter-sets
    yet to be processed as part of this phoneme.
  - B{C{previous_sound_parameters}} (list) - A list of all preceding
    parameter-sets introduced prior to the current paramter-set by language
    rules.
  - B{C{following_sound_parameters}} (list) - A list of all preceding
    parameter-sets introduced after to the current paramter-set by language
    rules.
  - B{C{parameters}} (list(33)) - A collection of parameters associated with the
    sound currently being procesed.
 
 Additionally, they must have the following return format:
  - B{tuple(3)} - A list of parameter-sets that precede this sound, a list of
    parameter-sets that follow this sound, and an f0 multiplier.
 
 All functions may modify the input parameter-set, C{parameters}.
 
 To enable use of a function you have defined, you must add a reference to the
 RULE_FUNCTIONS tuple, found at the end of this file.
