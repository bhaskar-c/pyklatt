\begin_layout Title
LING/CPSC 599 Project Write-up

\begin_layout Abstract
This paper describes an implementation of a Klatt-like synthesizer with
 provisions to enable approximations of human prosody in arbitrary languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
It features an interface that maps IPA input to synthesis parameters and
 applies some universal contour-shaping and sound-blending routines to create
 a generic speech stream.
 Language-specific rulesets may be applied to transform the speech stream
 into something that sounds more natural and understandable to speakers
 of the target language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This project was developed and advanced through the combination of the skills
 of a computer scientist, who wrote the synthesizer elements and implemented
 all transformational routines, and the knowledge of a linguist, who provided
 the content to use for synthesis, the prosody rules that were applied,
 and who defined the conditions under which the success of this project
 were to be evaluated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Project Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As any casual Google search will reveal, the Klatt synthesizer model, while
 a very interesting and significant step forward in synthesizer technology,
 really isn't all that good at sounding natural, especially by comparison
 to more modern solutions, such as Festival, which uses diphones sampled
 from the speech of an actual human, and therefore sounds a lot more pleasing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, the main problem with the Klatt model is how unnatural it sounds
 to native speakers of a language: it has no natural sound transitions,
 and it works by synthesizing essentially repeating patterns of sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another problem, although one understood to be more of a limitation in the
 technologies available at the time it was conceived, is that pure-IPA interface
s to the Klatt synthesizer did not seem to exist, which greatly increased
 the amount of time that had to be invested to attain meaningful results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project was advanced with three purposes in mind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To explore the potential of the Klatt syntheizer model applying strictly
 linear transformations to the sounds it produces, attempting to bring human-lik
e prosody to its monotone pulses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To make the synthesizer more accessible by implementing a pure-IPA interface
 that hides the internals from those without a need to see them
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To create a basis for future projects that may be undertaken by other students
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Organic nature of the problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interactive language of typical humans is based on a broad range of
 elements, all of which must work together to achieve the goals of producing
 and comprehending communicative utterances.
 Linguists, and those from other disciplines, have been studying the domain
 of language acquisition, development, and production, which covers subdisciplin
es including, but not limited to, semantics, syntax, phonology, neurolinguistics
, and pragmatics, with the intent of being able to reach a better understanding
 of this unique ability we share.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project, in particular, is an exploration of phonology, with a concentratio
n on its respectful sub-field of prosody.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope Definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the limited amount of time available to us during the semester
 in which this project was undertaken, we had to limit both the the scope
 and the depth of the aspects of the prosodic rules explored to the following
 areas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Smoothing transitions between phonemes
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Phonemes, in the Klatt model, are comprised of a single formant data-set.
 In reality, however, the formants that are produced are themselves influenced
 by the phonemes that surround them in the speech-stream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Although, when spoken in isolation, reasonably constant formant values may
 be observed for vowel sounds, when vowels appear next to other sounds --
 consonants and vowels alike, when neighbouring, will yield a biphone, and
 that must be accounted for if any synthetic speech is to sound believable.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Applying liaisons between words
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
As with phoneme transitions, a terminal consonant on a word will generally
 bleed into the vowel that leads its successor, even in Canadian English
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Applying nasalization patterns to vowels
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When a nasal-vowel sequence appears, the vowel is regressively nasalized
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Emphasized and quoted speech intonation patterns
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Increased pitch range and varied rates of speech, in accordance with normal
 Canadian patterns
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Content-word stressing
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Emphasis placed on words that serve to identify new content being added
 to a discussion
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Diphthong structuring
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Reduced emphasis on vowel-vowel clusters, reflecting how English speakers
 underplay the second constituent phoneme
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Vowel-liquid interaction
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Vowels take on some of the properties of a following liquid, improving the
 ability of the synthesizer to approximate human articulation patterns
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Pitch accents
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Although four main pitch accents are represented in English, we only implemented
 rules for three of them, two of which fall under question-related rising:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Falling tone
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Spoken English has a falling intonation pattern across a statement with
 added vowel-lengthening in the word-final position
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The full tone is used to indicate a turn-taking opportunity or belief in
 the content of the utterance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this case, even a question can have a falling tone, if the speaker already
 believes they know the answer; example: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't he nice[.|?]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (rhetorical|inquisitive)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Phrase-boundary rules were also applied: phrase breaks within ambiguous
 utterances can be disambiguated using appropriate intonation patterns that
 reflect syntactic parsing; examples: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Those who sold | quickly made a profit.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Those who sold quickly | made a profit.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Question-phrase intonation patterns
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\noun on
Low-rise
\noun default
: a rising tone applied to yes/no questions: utterances begin with a low
 tone, which progressively rises towards the end of the sentence; this intonatio
n pattern is used when the speaker genuinely doesnâ€™t know the answer to
 their question
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\noun on
High-rise
\noun default
: another rising tone, which applies to all other forms of questions: utterances
 begin with a medium tone and progressively rise towards the end of the
 sentence; this intonation pattern is used when asking for clarification
 or to imply disbelief
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
English prosody is a well-studied topic, so we had a solid basis upon which
 to begin our exploration.
 The challenge we faced was to determine how to translate organic, intuitive,
 often semantically bound properties of spoken language into mathematical
 formulas with only phonetic transcriptions to use as a basis for syntactic
 inference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We began by exploring some simple ideas, such as how a content word is given
 increased stress when spoken as part of a sentence, and expanded our rules
 from there.
 We also gave a great deal of attention to how each individual IPA character
 is rendered, carefully massaging frequencies and timing to achieve generally
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-sounding results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project has been implemented in Python, with extensive documentation.
 It is based on two relatively modern versions of the Klatt synthesizer
 model: the readily available GPLv1 Klatt 3.04 C implementation that is widely
 distributed across the Internet, and a Klatt Parallel/Cascade synthesizer
 implemented by Sean McLennan in Simulink for error-correction and data-simplifi
cation purposes.
 Full attribution is provided as part of the system's standard distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting system is a hybridization of both of these implementations,
 with the following additional features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
concurrent observation and control of the synthetic speech stream, allowing
 us to achieve more target-like transitions between sounds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
render-time availability of statistical information, enabling us to manipulate
 phonemes as they're processed, using highly precise, dynamic information
 sampled from the semantics present in their unique surrounding environments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
automatic IPA-to-speech processing
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
hides all of the intimidating strings of numbers that are typically associated
 with Klatt synthesizers from users who have no reason to work with them,
 and offers meaningful English terminology to those who do, without compromising
 efficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
enables behind-the-scenes pre-processing of the input IPA, letting the computer
 correct for details such as lengthening, shortening, and subtly epenthesizing
 phonemes where appropriate, and applying universal patterns that linguists
 generally take for granted when transcribing language
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
support for arbitrary language rule-sets and extension of the core synthesizer
 mechanics
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
allows the prosody rules of one language to be easily swapped out for another,
 making this system more versatile as a research project platform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
enables more advanced processing techniques to be implemented without compromisi
ng any other features that already exist or may come into being
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Assessment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Determining whether prosody had been improved was a largely subjective task,
 requiring the input and rationality of a human.
 We declared 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

success
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where we found that applying the rules we had devised resulted in speech
 that sounded, to others, more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than the same speech without modification; however, our definition of success
 is gradable: we are fully aware that the rules we have created are not,
 and cannot be, perfect -- such is not the nature of language to begin with
 -- so, accordingly, we could not take a pass/fail approach to this concept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall success, in our estimation, is a measure of how well all implemented
 rules stack to produce more natural-sounding speech; it is not based on
 how many rules we managed to create.
 As such, this project was, as planned, largely a process of learning and
 exploration, rather than an attempt to reach a point arbitrarily pre-determined
 as "satisfactory".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Evaluation Techniques
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To minimize bias, we hoped to use a number of our peers as evaluators, opting
 to expose them first to repeated playback of a sample not modified by language-
specific rule-sets, and then having them listen to a prosody-enhanced version
 of the same speech, with a comparison drawn between their comprehension
 of both forms; their personal preference would have also been taken into
 consideration.
 After exposure to both forms, once their blind comprehension had been measured,
 they were to be shown the IPA corresponding to what was heard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results and conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, we were able to coerce only a few volunteers to provide us
 with feedback, so our hopes for an unbiased sample fell short of expectations.
 However, we do feel that, based on what anecdotal evidence of success we
 received, we can declare that this project was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

for the win.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that, of those used as subjects, there was consensus that the prosodica
l enhancements made the speech easier to understand, although there were
 still words that were determined to be unclear until the IPA transcriptions
 were shown.
 By and large, the words with which comprehension difficulty was reported
 matched those we expected to be problematic, and they stem from a fundamental
 weakness with the cascade-parallel Klatt model: aspiration and rolling
 sounds are hard to produce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Further extension
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned, under Project Background, one of the motivating factors behind
 this project was the potential for its use as a basis for future projects
 by other students.
 To this end, a short guide to extending the system's capabilities is provided
 as part of the standard distribution, and all code is thoroughly documented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One area in which attention should be focused is on artificial aspiration
 and sound modulation: implementing a randomly shifting pattern for problematic
 phonemes would likely go a long way towards making them more audible and,
 therefore, overcoming the greatest obstacle this system faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another would be on the formant-mapped values that implement the IPA sounds.
 All of the source data is British in origin, which conflicts, just a little,
 with Canadian phonological recognition.
